      <h1 class="site-title">Welcome to my page!</h1><img src="images/me.jpg" alt="Elias Muzemil (Me)">
      <p class="sub-title">Hello everyone. My name is Elias Muzemil and I am on the autism spectrum. I am majoring in information technology and management and this will be my first semester at IIT. Prior to IIT, I took Truman college classes on C++ and Java programming, and I participated in Excelerate's online internship programs for data visualization, innovation and entrepreneurship, and cybersecurity. My goal is to get an A in this class and I am willing to work hard for it.</p>
      <p class="sub-title">My family consists of my mother and father, who have divorced since I was in kindergarten, and my two older sisters; Sonia, who is currently 24 years old and lives in an apartment in Chicago, and Hanan, who is currently 26 years old, engaged, and will be officially wedded this December. My maternal grandparents are my grandfather, who currently resides in a retirement home near Sonia's apartment, and my unfortunately deceased grandmother, who used to make good wot with injera and passed away from cancer back in May 2019. I have three paternal aunts and one paternal uncle whose apartment buildings we occassionally visit to eat their cooked wot with injera, and my paternal uncle teaches me how to drive a car whenever I have the free time.</p>
